### Introduction
Sales analysis is essential for any business to understand customer behavior, track product performance, and identify growth opportunities. This project demonstrates how to extract insights from sales data by combining calendar details, customer information, and product data. The analysis is visualized using Power BI, providing interactive reports for better decision-making.
### Steps

#### Data Sources
The project leverages two datasets located within the "Datasets" folder. Subsequently, SQL queries are executed on these datasets, and the resulting outputs are stored in Excel format.

#### Excel Tables:
Available in SQL/SQL Output folder.
- Calendar Details
- Customer Details
- Product Details
- Internet Sales
#### SQL Queries:
Available in SQL/SQL Queries folder.
#### Loading Data
1. Load the Excel tables (Calendar, Customer, Product, Internet Sales) into Power BI.
2. Utilize SQL queries from the SQL folder to extract relevant sales budget data.
#### Defining Relationships
1. Define relationships between tables based on common keys (e.g., product key, customer ID, etc.).
2. Ensure that relationships are correctly established to enable meaningful data connections.
